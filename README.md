# Drum Machine

As the "keeper of the rhythm," the drum provides the foundation for the overall sound of music. Because a drum only has to be hit to make a sound, it is also one of the 
simplest of the instruments. So let's explore the software design of such an amazing instrument of our music industry. You can see the project with code on the given [JSFiddle Link](https://jsfiddle.net/nazmeen/gc5upy07/195/).

**Technologies I used:** 
-JavaScript 
-HTML5 
-CSS3 
-Bootstrap5 
-React.js
-jQuery

**How it works:** 
Here is a summary of the appâ€™s functionality. The renders few buttons displaying letters on it, a label that displays a string associated with it. On CLick method of 
React Component triggers playSound method which plays the beat associated with the letter. Also you can make use of keyboard keys to trigger the beat of drum. We store 
the state of text that is being displayed in association with the beat, each time the beat is triggered through letter the state of string displayer changes and sets it 
to the current beat string.
